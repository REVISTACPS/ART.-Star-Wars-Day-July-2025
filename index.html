      <h1>May the Fourth Be With You</h1>

    <p class="author">Existe una línea que une la primera victoria electoral de Margaret Thatcher con la saga de Star Wars y que, con un hábil juego fonético, da lugar a una fiesta de cosplay.</p>

    <p>
      Fans of Star Wars, the popular science fiction saga that began in 1977, celebrate Star Wars Day every year on 4 May. This date was chosen because of a pun on the film’s famous saying “May the Force be with you.” As everyone knows, Americans officially use the month/day/year format to write the date. Therefore, the date 4 May is ‘May 4th’ in America. By swapping the word ‘fourth’ for ‘force’… Get it? A clever play on words occurs! That’s how a new international event to celebrate everything Star Wars was born.
    </p>

    <div class="subtheme">A BRITISH PUN</div>

    <p>Even though Star Wars was an an American movie that later became franchise, the Star Wars Day pun originated in the UK. On 4 May 1979 Margaret Thatcher was elected as Britain’s first female Prime Minister. To congratulate her, a British tabloid printed a half-page headline that read: “May the Fourth Be with You, Maggie.” British tabloids are famous for their wordplay, which contributes to their eye-catching headlines. Star Wars, released two years earlier, had made a huge cultural impact around the world. The play on words was easy to understand and the phrase quickly became popular. With the rise of the internet, the phrase spread even more.</p>

    <div class="subtheme">MAY THE FOURTH</div>

    <p>On Star Wars Day, fans around the world enjoy different activities: they invite fellow Star Wars-obsessed friends to watch the whole original saga in a marathon viewing, dress up as their favourite characters, attend events and cosplay contests, play Star Wars video games or buy Star Wars merchandise at special discounts. Many also post Star Wars memes and jokes on social media using the hashtag #MayThe4thBeWithYou.</p>

    <div class="subtheme">TO CANADA NEXT!</div>

            <p>The first official Star Wars Day event was held in Toronto, Canada on 4 May 2011, with a costume contest and a film festival. Soon, more places joined in, and the celebration grew worldwide. In 2012, The Walt Disney Company bought Lucasfilm, the company that created Star Wars. Some fans worried that Star Wars Day would disappear, but the opposite happened: since 4 May 2013, Disney Parks have hosted official Star Wars events, including character meet-and-greets, limited-edition merchandise releases, Jedi training activities for kids, Star Wars-themed dance parties, and fireworks shows set to Star Wars music.

            What better way to celebrate than by grabbing a lightsaber and staging an epic battle between good and evil? And May the 4th be with you!
                </p>

        <div class="subtheme">TRADITIONS</div>

    <p>
     Historically, milkmaids would wear their finest clothes, carry decorated milk pails and dance in front of their customers’ houses in exchange for tips. Chimney sweeps would also make the most of May Day, which was their only day off. The event starts early in the day to pay homage to the sweeps’ long working hours. They wear garlands and greenery, which grew more eye-catching and outlandish over time, leading to the creation of Jack. Jack is a character dressed in foliage and leaves. For the event, a real person wears a head-to-toe leafy structure and a crown made of flowers.
    </p>
    <div class="subtheme">PROCESSION</div>
    <p>
      As the most important member of the procession, Jack leads the revellers down the streets of the Old Town. He is accompanied by local dancers, chimney sweeps, milkmaids, the May Queen, giant figures, and Sal and the Bogies. They protect Jack and prevent onlookers from getting too close. If anyone does so, or if the Bogies happen to notice you didn’t abide by the green dress code, they’ll dab your nose with some green face paint as they pass by. The parade heads up to Hastings’ West Hill, where Jack is ‘slain’; he is stripped of his leaves, welcoming in the spirit of summer. Traditionally, catching one of Jack’s leaves as they are thrown into the air is said to bring good luck.
    </p>

    <div class="subtheme">REVIVAL</div>

    <p>
      Until 1889, at least two groups in the Hastings area celebrated Jack in the Green. However,  by the early 20th century the custom had disappeared. In the 1970s, there was a revival of many folk traditions, which led in 1983 to the creation of Hastings Traditional Jack in the Green by Mad Jack’s Morris, a Morris-dancing troupe now known as Hastings RX Morris. The troupe is still involved in the organisation of the event to this day. Visitors can expect to see traditional folk dances, folk musicians in concert, and Scottish and Irish barn dances, called ‘ceilidhs’. Don’t forget to wear green if you plan on attending — or failing that, pick up some leaves on your way there and put them in your hair!
